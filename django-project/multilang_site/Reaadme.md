    Open a terminal and navigate to the main directory.
    Run the command python -m pip install django to install Django.
    Run the command django-admin startproject main to create a new Django project called main.
    This will create a new directory main with the following structure:

main/

main/

settings.py

urls.py

wsgi.py

__init__.py

manage.py

    Move your schema.sql file into the main directory.
    Open the settings.py file and configure your database settings. For example, you can use SQLite as your database:

python

DATABASES = {

    'default': {

        'ENGINE': 'django.db.backends.sqlite3',

        'NAME': os.path.join(BASE_DIR, 'db.sqlite3'),

    }

}

    Run the command python manage.py migrate to create the database tables.
    Run the command python manage.py runserver to start the Django development server.

As for your main.py file, you can delete it since it's not needed anymore. The manage.py file is used to interact with your Django project.

If you want to create a new Django app, you can run the command python manage.py startapp myapp (replace myapp with your app name). This will create a new directory myapp with the following structure:

myapp/

models.py

views.py

templates/

__init__.py

apps.py

tests.py

urls.py

You can then add your app to the INSTALLED_APPS setting in settings.py:

python

INSTALLED_APPS = [

    # ...

    'myapp.apps.MyappConfig',

]
